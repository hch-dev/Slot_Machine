## ðŸŽ² Mathematics Involved  

This project does not rely only on random spins, it also implements the **mathematical principles** used in real-world slot machines:  

- **Probability Distribution:**  
  Each symbol has a different probability of appearing on different reels.  

- **Payout Calculation:**  
  Payouts are calculated based on the combination of symbols and their odds. The rarer the symbol, the higher the payout.  

- **Expected Value (EV):**  
  The return-to-player (RTP) percentage is considered to simulate realistic slot machine behavior.
